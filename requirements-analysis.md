# Pixel Adventure - Requirements Analysis

## UI Components Analysis

Based on the provided screenshot and description, here's a detailed breakdown of the UI components and functionality required for the Pixel Adventure sprite generation interface:

### 1. Overall Layout
- Three-panel layout with left sidebar, central preview area, and right sidebar
- Header with "Pixel Adventure" title
- Clean, minimal design with light/neutral background
- Responsive layout considerations

### 2. Left Sidebar - "Sprite Sets"
- Header labeled "Sprite Sets"
- List of sprite sets with unique IDs (e.g., "Set: 018764")
- Each sprite set displays thumbnail previews of frames (4-5 frames visible per set)
- Delete button for each sprite set
- Expand/collapse functionality ("+2" indicators for additional frames)
- Selection mechanism to choose active sprite set

### 3. Central Area - "Animation Preview"
- Large preview window for displaying animated sprites
- "Animation Preview" header
- Speed slider control (slow to fast)
- Play/Pause button
- Frame counter showing current frame and total frames (e.g., "Frame 3 of 6 (9 FPS)")
- Clean white background for the animation preview

### 4. Right Sidebar - "Frames"
- Header labeled "Frames"
- List of individual frames with thumbnails
- Frame naming (e.g., "Frame 1", "Frame 2")
- File information for each frame (e.g., "1.png")
- Up/down arrows for reordering frames
- Mechanism to select individual frames

### 5. Control Panel (Central Top Area)
- Style dropdown (e.g., "8-bit")
- Object/Character dropdown (e.g., "goblin")
- Action dropdown (e.g., "dancing")
- Background dropdown (e.g., "in the battlefield")
- Progress indicator (e.g., "5 of 8 frames generated")
- Prompt input area with example: 'Complete: "8-bit" + "character" + "walking" or "pixel art" + "explosion" + "in sequence"'

### 6. Additional Features
- Frame generation functionality
- Animation speed control
- Export capabilities (implied but not directly shown in UI)
- Save/load sprite sets
- Frame management (add, delete, reorder)

## Technical Requirements

1. **Frontend Framework**: Next.js with Tailwind CSS for styling
2. **Animation Engine**: Custom JavaScript animation system for sprite animation
3. **State Management**: React state/context for managing application state
4. **File Handling**: Client-side file handling for importing/exporting sprites
5. **Responsive Design**: Ensure usability across different screen sizes
6. **Image Processing**: Canvas or image manipulation libraries for sprite sheet generation

## User Workflow

1. User selects or creates a sprite set
2. User configures style, object, action, and background
3. User generates or imports frames
4. User previews animation with speed control
5. User can edit, reorder, or delete frames
6. User can export animation as sprite sheet or animated GIF
7. User can save sprite sets for future editing

## Design Principles

1. **Clarity**: Clear labeling and intuitive controls
2. **Minimalism**: Focus on sprite content with minimal UI distraction
3. **Consistency**: Uniform styling and interaction patterns
4. **Feedback**: Visual feedback for user actions
5. **Efficiency**: Streamlined workflow for sprite creation and editing
